## Introduction

After the Grand Theft Auto VI trailer was leaked early, Rockstar Games decided to post it immediately.

We finally have our first look at modern-day Vice City, along with the protagonists of the game (Lucia and Jason).

Now that the GTA 6 trailer is officially out in the wild, Rockstar has revealed additional details about the game, including the platforms it will be available on.

## Details

GTA 6 is taking us back to Vice City. While the original game was set in 1986, this new 2025 release is set to take place in what appears to be a modern day setting. Rockstar revealed we'll be heading to the state of Leonida which is "home to the neon-soaked streets of Vice City and beyond". Set to be the "biggest, most immersive evolution of Grand Theft Auto yet", Vice City appears to be a part of a bigger map that will form GTA 6. 

## Conclusion

All the fans of the GTA series are looking forward to day its released. Because the developers try their best to entertain gamers and bring the best thing that ever made to that day always.
